RabbitMQ

RabbitMQ is open source message broker software (sometimes called message-oriented middleware) that implements the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP). The RabbitMQ server is written in the Erlang programming language and is built on the Open Telecom Platform framework for clustering and failover.

Since RabbitMQ is built on top of Erlang, we will first need to install Erlang. Got to the Erlang downloads(https://www.erlang.org/downloads) page and download the erlang binary file(OTP 21.2 Windows 64-bit Binary File) for windows which is an executable

Next run the binary file downloaded and install erlang on your machine.

Go to RabbitMQ downloads(https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html) page and download RabbitMQ installation
This will be a .exe installation file for windows

Run this exe and install RabbitMQ on your machine

We will now start Rabbit. The above installation should have installed the RabbitMQ command prompt. Open it.

Go to the RabbitMQ Server Location and use the command as follows-
rabbitmq-server start

Next we will install the RabbitMQ plugin which will give use the RabbitMQ Management Console which is accessible using the browser. For this use the command as follows-
rabbitmq-plugins.bat enable rabbitmq_management

Next go to localhost:15672.We will see the RabbitMQ console. The default username and password is guest
